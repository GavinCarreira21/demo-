# demo-
A demo project from Kids can code. 
'''
**********Gameplay ideas:
have bullets shoot out of the enemy to destroy incoming mobs 

*****failed ideas 
My main goal in creating this project was to have the chracter fire bullets at the 
incoming eneimies, much like a concept from the orginal doodle jump. I started out watching Kids can code 
videos and coding along, but later realized I was way over my head and some of the code I was beginning 
to put was stuff I had never seen before, this ultimatley caused me to start over

**********Cosmetics
change clouds, enemies, sound, jump, explorer, platforms, added portals

**********Bugs
will not read spritesheet... "name 'Spritesheet' is not defined"

**********Gameplay fixes
increased boost and jump to decrese impossible jump zones 

**********Features
increased mobs, with added boosts, and higher powerups and jumps
